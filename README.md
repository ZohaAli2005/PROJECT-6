# PROJECT-6

This project is a modern, responsive frontend web application developed using HTML5 and CSS3, with a strong focus on clean design, usability, and performance. The goal of the project was to create a structured and visually engaging interface that adapts seamlessly to different screen sizes and devices, ensuring a consistent user experience across desktops, tablets, and smartphones.

The layout is built using well-organized semantic HTML elements, while CSS is used to manage typography, color schemes, spacing, and overall visual hierarchy. Responsive techniques such as flexible layouts and media queries are implemented to optimize the design for various resolutions. The project also includes form components with properly styled input fields and buttons, demonstrating practical UI design and basic user interaction handling.

Attention was given to code readability, maintainability, and best practices, making the project scalable and easy to enhance in the future. This project highlights core frontend development skills, including responsive design, layout structuring, and UI styling, and reflects the ability to translate design concepts into functional, polished web interfaces suitable for real-world applications.
